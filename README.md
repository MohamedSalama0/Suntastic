# Problem:

Although adoption of solar energy was slow at first, a number of state and federal incentives and policies contributed to driving down the cost of solar panels far enough to become more widely adopted. At this point, solar power accounts for enough capacity to power 11 million of the 126 million households in the country.



  Solar energy is a clean, inexpensive, renewable power source that is nearly everywhere in the world - any point where sunlight hits the surface of the earth is a potential location to generate solar power. That’s why households began to use solar Panels on their roofs to provide clean, cheap and renewable energy.

Investments in renewable energy are increasing and this leaves a good sign for the increasing job opportunities for the employees in the field of power and energy.

The problems start with the idea that the sun isn’t sustainable all day-long or even for months in some countries. Also, clouds hinder some of the sunlight which makes the energy is less than expected.

 The solution for this is to store this energy whenever it’s available in batteries to use them at any time. Another solution is to monitor the sunshine in your area through our application and to compare last data with current one. This will give you perspective to what is coming.

Another problem that may exist is that we cannot predict the amount of sunshine unless we use technology like Machine learning.
 Comparing the data of the sunshine for previous years can also give us insight for the future of solar power. So we headed for a tool to be used as guidance for public users to help them deal with solar energy and encourage them to build solar panels because using clean energy can save our world. 
 However, Machine Learning is on our vision as it will be different, new and helpful.

# Solution

We designed an easy mobile application to the public users to be able to know how much solar power available in a certain area. Using this, one can have sufficient information to decide whether solar panels would be helpful in his area or not.

For the ones who live in areas where much sunshine available, this app will provide a guidance for them to be able to compare the energy from the sun over the moths or even years.

 Comparing the energy over the years helps predict how the solar power will be in the future, meanwhile installing solar panels to use clean and cheap energy.
We provided four main parameters for renewable sources of energy for the user; Solar power, wind, pressure and Temperature.
Graphs are provided and they are easy to read.
The user will also find the button called "Solar Panel" which will help them know Solar panels auto-updated prices and there's an option to access a website to buy them online.

Graphs and Charts will help the users to understand how the energy goes and how the energy was.


  Users have the option to choose a specific location to calculate and monitor the energy in his location.

# Solar Panels
We create A screen that give you accses to amazon.com to buy any solar panels generator if you need

 We converted the existed daily average energy into weekly average energy over a year. We also provided a full year data for 2020 solar energy to compare it with 2019 or even with the current year. Meanwhile, users can predict the coming potential energy from the sun.
 
 ![date](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88866544/136127144-1b6d74c3-b707-4661-896b-83f428e6b2e8.PNG)

We have provided an option for the user to select date range for the period of time which they would like to get information about like how much solar energy reaches their area. Also this helps to know when seasons of the year or even the clouds reduce the amount of the solar energy which reaches their area.

We used “The power” website to customize data and parameters using APIs which we used in our application after processing and calculating the weekly average of the solar energy.
